### Features of FuseWP Lite

FuseWP [subscribes WordPress users after registration to your email list based on their user roles](https://fusewp.com/article/sync-wordpress-users-email-list-based-on-user-roles/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=liteversion). If users update their profile information or change their account email address, their profile changes are automatically synchronized to your email marketing software and CRM. And if users' accounts are deleted, they are automatically unsubscribed.

FuseWP can [export, bulk-sync, or batch-process existing WordPress users](https://fusewp.com/article/bulk-sync-existing-users-memberships-records/) to your CRM and email marketing platforms as contacts.

It can replace Zapier, Integromat / Make, Pabbly Connect, LeadsBridge, and other automator and integration tools that connect WordPress to your CRM.
